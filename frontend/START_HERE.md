## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before You Start

2. ✅ Add CORS middleware to backend
3. ✅ Have Python 3.7+ or Node.js installed
4. ✅ Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### First-Time Setup
1. **Admin User:** Must be created via database (see SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. **Backend URL:** Update `js/config.js` if not using localhost:8000
3. **Testing:** Create test elections and candidates as admin first

### Common Issues
- **Can't connect:** Check backend is running and CORS is enabled
- **No elections:** Admin must create and start elections first
- **Can't login:** Verify credentials, try registering new account
- **Admin features hidden:** User must have `is_admin = true` in database
